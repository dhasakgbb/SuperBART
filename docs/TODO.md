# Outstanding TODOs

## Description
Tracks remaining work and polish items so publishing and post-publish iterations are clear and actionable.

## Before Publish
- [ ] Commit project files in `/Users/damian/GitHub/NES/SuperBART` and push to `origin/main`.
- [ ] Verify `npm run dev`, `npm run test`, `npm run validate`, and `npm run build` on a clean shell.
- [ ] Capture one gameplay screenshot/gif for README.
- [ ] Confirm no local-only artifacts are accidentally tracked.

## Gameplay Polish Backlog
- [ ] Add an automated browser integration test for full spawn-to-goal traversal.
- [ ] Add deterministic test coverage for stomp-vs-side-hit edge angles.
- [ ] Tune jump and enemy patrol constants using short playtest notes.
- [ ] Add a lightweight title/start overlay and win/lose summary screen polish.

## Technical Polish Backlog
- [ ] Reduce production bundle size warning via code splitting or adjusted chunking.
- [ ] Add optional CI workflow file (GitHub Actions) to codify current command matrix.
- [x] Added `public/favicon.svg` and linked it in `index.html` to remove dev-console 404 noise.

## Documentation Follow-ups
- [ ] Keep this TODO list in sync with ticket status.
- [ ] Add changelog once first published tag exists.
