# SuperBART Game Design (Canonical)

`SCRIPT.md` is the canonical game design document for SuperBART V3.

## Canon Rule

- `SCRIPT.md` is source-of-truth for premise, worlds, pacing, mechanics, choices, endings, and tone.
- This file intentionally stays short and points implementation to the script alignment matrix.

## Implementation Pointers

- Script section ownership map: `docs/script_alignment_matrix.md`
- Runtime content contracts: `src/content/contentManifest.ts`
- Campaign authored spec: `src/levelgen/scriptCampaignLevels.ts`
- Narrative payloads: `src/content/scriptNarrative.ts`

## Legacy Note

The pre-V3 enterprise satire campaign docs are archived by git history only and are not canonical for current development.
