# Legacy Web Runtime Reference Index

This folder preserves legacy Phaser/TypeScript materials used for deterministic comparison and parity work.

## Contents

- `../legacy_runtime_reference.md` — Canonical boundary statement for what the web runtime still means.
- `../unity_cutover_plan.md` — Hard Unity-only migration status and non-negotiables.

## Rule

Only apply changes in `docs/legacy_web` for historical reference and verification workflow.
All shipping decisions, release gates, and runtime fixes now belong to `unity-port-kit` and `docs/unity_port.md`.
